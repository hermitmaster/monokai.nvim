# nvim-monokai

My take on monokai for neovim.

## Installation

Requires neovim 0.5.0+

Behaves like any other colorscheme, except it requires neovim 0.5.0+ because it's written in lua.
Use you favorite plugin manager and call the colorscheme.

```
...
Plug 'hermitmaster/nvim-monokai'
...

colorscheme monokai
```
